# One editor buffer per file

Status: proposed. This replaces the open drafts #30714, #30681 and #30417, and builds on the merged guarded write (#30605).

## Problem

Orca keeps a file's text, and its "last known disk version", in many separate places:

- fields stored per tab in the store (unsaved draft, dirty flag, disk signature, changed-on-disk mark, autosave pauses)
- each panel's `fileContents` and `diffContents` caches
- `editorDrafts`
- the shared text model
- the rich markdown, notebook and CSV views
- combined-diff sections
- the mobile bridge

About twenty review rounds across three draft PRs kept finding one kind of bug: a save or a check took the text from one copy and the disk version from another. Four examples:

1. **One workspace overwrites another.** Two workspaces open the same file. They share the text model but each keeps its own dirty flag. Typing in A changes the text in B, but B still thinks it is clean, so B autosaves or restores old text.
2. **An old cache wins.** A panel that opens after a save or reload still holds the disk text from before it. It pushes that old text into the shared model.
3. **Clean tab, leftover draft.** After you undo back to the saved text, the dirty check says clean. That check compares content, and for markdown it ignores trailing whitespace. A draft is still left in the store, and hot exit, the preview and mobile keep using it.
4. **Banner actions race.** Reload, its Undo toast and a disk read still in progress each write the draft, the disk version and the text separately. If you type in between, the results get mixed.

## Goals and non-goals

**Goals:**

- One record per physical file holds its text, dirty state, disk version, conflict state and save queue.
- Every writer goes through the record, and every view of the file is a projection of it.
- Dirty state comes from edit versions, not from comparing content.
- Reloading from disk can be undone.
- Every save, from any view, is checked against the disk when it is written.

**Non-goals:**

- Merging edits from several writers.
- A three-way merge screen.
- Host-side changes beyond the optional `currentSignature` field on a refused write.
- Treating symlinks or hardlinks to one file as a single document.

## Model

### Identity

The **record id** is the execution host plus a normalized path:

- **Host**:
  - `local`.
  - A WSL distro. `\\wsl$` and `\\wsl.localhost` paths name the same distro and give the same key.
  - An SSH target, keyed by `(runtimeEnvironmentId, targetId)`. Keeping the runtime namespace keeps a direct target and the same target nested under a runtime separate. Reconnect generations and connection ids are not part of the key.
  - A runtime environment.
  - Host keys include the continuity revision from `runtime-environment-revision.ts`.
    - A re-pair proven to be the same machine maps to the same key, so sharing survives the reconnect.
    - A retired id quarantines its records: they are kept as recoverable drafts and never merged with the new machine's records.
    - 1b tests a replacement host with an identical path and identical baseline text.
- **Path**: separators and drive letters are normalized, and case is kept exactly. Case sensitivity can differ per directory (on Windows, and under WSL), so it is never folded from a cached volume property. Two paths that differ only in case join one record only when the host proves they are the same file, with the same file id or inode from a stat.

The workspace is never part of the id, and the id never goes over the wire.

The **text model URI** is separate. It can't change for the life of a model, and for hosts that aren't local it carries an `/.orca-owner/<hash>/` folder that keeps the file name last for the language service.

- **Owner resolves late**: when the owner isn't known yet, `editor-model-owner.ts` falls back to `unresolved` + worktree + file id. Once the owner resolves, that provisional record joins the real one:
  - If the real record doesn't exist, the provisional record is re-keyed to it.
  - If both exist and only one is dirty, the dirty one wins.
  - If both are dirty, the other draft becomes a recoverable copy (see Restore).
- **Rename**:
  - The record is re-keyed. The URI can't change, so a new model is built from the old model's text, dirty state and baseline, and the old model is disposed. Undo history doesn't survive the rename, which matches today's behaviour.
  - If the target path already has a record, the rename counts as an external change to it. If that record is clean, its views attach to the moved record. If it is dirty, its draft becomes a recoverable copy.
- **Dirty and dirty joins before 1d**: until the recovery UI exists, any join where both sides are dirty keeps both records separate and unshared. That covers owner resolution, restored legacy drafts that differ (in one workspace or two), and a rename onto a dirty record.

### Fields

| Field | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | The text model, which is the only editable copy. It is `null` for files Orca doesn't edit as text (too large, binary, image). Those records keep only `baseline` and `conflict`, and every write is refused. |
| `savedAltVersion` | `model.getAlternativeVersionId()` when the text last matched disk. Dirty means `getAlternativeVersionId() !== savedAltVersion`. The alternative id goes back to an earlier value on undo, which `getVersionId` doesn't. |
| `baseline` | The `getDiskBaselineSignature` of the decoded disk text that `savedAltVersion` matches (`src/shared/disk-baseline-signature.ts`). |
| `conflict` | `{ observed, consent? }`. `observed` is the disk version an outside change produced, or "deleted". `consent` is the version the user agreed to overwrite. |
| `autosavePause` | Why autosave is paused (restore check, disk check, undo past a reload), with a generation number so a save clears only the pause it saw. |
| `reloadBoundary` | The alternative version ids immediately before and after the last reload. |
| `saveQueue` | Runs this file's saves one at a time, with a single autosave timer. |
| `views` | The tabs and panes showing the file. Each keeps only its own scroll position, selection and mode. |

Version ids restart when a model is recreated, for example after a dispose and reopen or a rename. A new model is built from the record's text, and its `savedAltVersion` is set as follows:

- The record was clean: `savedAltVersion` is the new model's current id.
- The record was dirty: `savedAltVersion` is set to a sentinel the model can never reach, so the file stays dirty until the next save or reload.

### Lifecycles

- **Open**: the first view creates the record, setting the text, `savedAltVersion` and `baseline` in one step. Views opened later attach to it and see the current unsaved edits.
- **Close**: the view detaches. Only closing the last view asks to save. After that, the model follows the existing lifetime rules for undo after closing.
- **External change**:
  - A watcher event that matches a self-write stamp (an echo of Orca's own save) is ignored.
  - Otherwise, a clean record reloads, and a dirty record sets `conflict.observed`, which shows the banner on every view and pauses autosave.
- **Reload**: reloads run on the record's save queue, so a reload and a save never overlap.
  1. Watcher events are coalesced, the same way the shipped `editor-watcher-reload-coalescer.ts` does it. Note the alternative version id, then read the file.
  2. If the version is unchanged, apply the snapshot, even if newer watcher events arrived during the read, and schedule one follow-up read for those events. This keeps a file under continuous writes making progress.
     - The snapshot goes in as one undoable programmatic edit.
     - Then `savedAltVersion`, `baseline` and `reloadBoundary` are updated and `conflict` is cleared.
  3. If the user typed during the read, discard the snapshot. The record is dirty now, so set `conflict.observed` if the disk text differs from `baseline`. A clean record never shows the banner from a reload, so the banner doesn't flicker.
  4. Undoing back to the "before" id in `reloadBoundary` pauses autosave until the user saves or redoes.
- **Keep My Edits**: sets `conflict.consent` to `conflict.observed`, clears the banner and resumes autosave. It doesn't read the disk. The banner names the file but may not show the new content, so Keep is consent to overwrite content the user may not have seen. This is deliberate.
- **Save**:
  - Capture `{text, altVersion, baseline, consent}` in one tick, then do a guarded write that expects `consent ?? baseline`.
  - On success:
    - `savedAltVersion` becomes the captured `altVersion`.
    - `baseline` becomes the signature of the written text.
    - `conflict.consent` is cleared.
    - No reload can overlap the save, because both run on the queue. The file is then dirty exactly when the user has typed since the capture, so undoing back to an older text after a slow save correctly shows dirty.
  - A refusal sets `conflict.observed` to `currentSignature`. Some shipped hosts advertise `files.write.disk-precondition.v1` but return no `currentSignature`. For those, Orca does a read pinned to the same connection to learn the disk version, or that the file was deleted, before Keep is offered.
  - Autosave never recreates a deleted file. An explicit save may.
- **Restore**:
  - Sessions never store drafts. A draft is derived from each dirty record (its text plus `baseline`) when the session is saved, so a clean record can't leave one behind.
  - A restored record starts dirty, with autosave paused until the disk has been checked.
  - Sessions in the old per-tab format can have several drafts for one file with no ordering. Identical drafts are merged. A divergent draft stays as a recoverable copy, offered on the tab, until the user picks one or discards it. Orca never picks the newest by itself.
  - When an older Orca reads a session written by a newer one:
    - The derived draft is written into every tab showing the file, in the old per-tab shape, with optional fields the older build ignores.
    - Recoverable copies are lost.
- **Remote hosts**:
  - The guarded write runs on the host that executes it: the main process for local and WSL, the runtime for SSH and remote hosts. It is pinned to the connection that answered the capability check.
  - A runtime too old to have the capability falls back to the client reading the file and comparing it. That fallback isn't atomic.
  - If contact with the host is lost, the record and its draft stay. Nothing is thrown away or reloaded until the host answers again.

## How each view maps onto the record

| View | Mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Code editor and split panes | Views attach to `model` directly. |
| Markdown source mode | Same as the code editor. |
| Markdown rich mode | A commit is a user edit on `model`, so it can be undone and marks the file dirty. The view re-renders when the model changes. |
| Notebook | Cell edits serialize into `model`, and the notebook re-parses when the version changes. |
| CSV | Cell edits become range edits on `model`. The byte index is keyed by version. |
| Unstaged diff (single-file or combined section) | Only the modified side, which is the working file, attaches to the record and saves through it. |
| Staged and branch diffs | Separate read-only snapshot models, outside the record. |
| Markdown preview | Read-only text from `model`. Its Save is a record save but never counts as consent to overwrite. |
| Mobile bridge | Keeps publishing one projection per tab, so the wire format doesn't change. A mobile save becomes an edit, with its own undo boundary, plus a save on the record. A failed save rolls back only if the model is still at the version that edit produced. Otherwise the current text is kept and the failure is reported, mirroring `restoreFailedMobileSaveDraft`. Phase 3 tests desktop typing during a failing mobile save. |

**Interim adapter (from 1b until Phase 3).** Views that haven't been converted keep their own undo and route only their text through the record:

- `record.applyText(text, source)` replaces the model's text as one edit.
  - Because these edits never undo through the model, dirty for them can't come from version ids. If the applied text's signature equals `baseline`, `savedAltVersion` is set to the current id, so undoing to clean in the view reads clean.
- `record.pending`: views that publish on a delay (rich markdown waits 300 ms) register pending text on the record.
  - Each delayed view tracks the model's alternative version for the text last installed in it. This is updated with every programmatic sync into the view, and it becomes the base of the view's next pending edit.
  - The record flushes pending text before any dirty decision, close prompt, autosave or session capture, and before another view on the same record writes. Another view's first edit forces the flush, so exiting before the timer fires keeps the edit.
  - `applyText` replaces the text only if the model is still at the captured base. Otherwise the stale commit is not applied. It is kept as a recoverable copy and shown to the user. Until 1d it is shown through the existing Compare dialog.
- Disk loads go through `record.loadFromDisk(text, signature)`:
  - Until 1d, the callers are the panel `fileContents` loader and the buffer content sync.
  - From 1d until Phase 2, the callers are the file loader on open and the existing watcher reload.

From 1b until 1d, a file whose only view is rich, notebook or CSV holds its text twice: once in its model and once in the panel cache. The watch exceptions from #30415 stay until Phase 3.

## Migration plan

### Phase 1: the record

Phase 1 ships as four PRs. After each one, behaviour matches main except for the change that PR names.

- **1a. Record as state only.**
  - **Change**:
    - Add a buffer slice that is the source of truth for exactly these `OpenFile` fields: `isDirty`, `lastKnownDiskSignature`, `externalMutation`, `pendingDiskBaselineVerification`, `pendingLiveDiskVerification` and `pendingOwnerMigration`.
    - Two things stay where they are in 1a. `editorDrafts` moves only in 1d. `pendingSelfMoveEcho` is a transient of the move itself, so it stays on the tab.
    - The `OpenFile` fields stay as a synchronized mirror, written in the same store update as the record. All of today's readers and tests keep working (about 139 test files build `OpenFile`s with these fields, plus 236 references outside tests). 1d removes the mirror.
    - The slice is keyed by the existing `OpenFile.id`, which makes the move purely mechanical. On main one path can already have several records in one workspace: unstaged diff tabs with their own id, draft and model; diverging duplicate siblings (`editor-close-document-siblings.test.ts`); and siblings that differ in read-only state, mode or owner generation. 1a keeps all of them.
    - Writers update the record instead of the tab.
    - The lifecycle follows `openFiles` membership, in the same reducer step:
      - **Create** on open, on hydrate (including the id re-keying in `hydrated-editor-file-ids.ts`) and on mirrored web-client tabs.
      - **Delete** on close and on worktree teardown.
      - **Re-key** on every id change: the atomic self-move re-key, `open-file-path-rekey.ts`, and layout moves through `workspace-layout-beside.ts` and `workspace-layout-disk-fields.ts`.
      - A missing record is seeded from its `OpenFile`, never from defaults.
    - Text models are untouched. They stay one per URI, shared as on main, and are written only by today's paths, at today's times.
    - Dirty stays main's content compare (including the markdown trailing-whitespace leniency).
  - **Tests**:
    - Existing suites pass unchanged.
    - A store invariant, checked after every `set` in dev and test builds: the set of records equals the set of edit-tab ids, and every mirror field equals its record.
    - Each writer lands in the record and its mirror atomically.
    - A dirty change propagates to each reader that depends on `openFiles` identity or fields: `web-session-tabs-sync/state-equality-files.ts`, session save in `lib/workspace-session.ts`, the mobile session projections, and `mobile-markdown-bridge.ts`.
- **1b. Sharing across workspaces.**
  - **Change**: these land together, because sharing without the queue or the close rule would let one workspace's Discard or autosave clobber the other's edits, and model writes without one record per model reopen the stale-text path:
    - Collapse ids: every edit-mode record that already shares a text model, across workspaces and including read-only siblings, joins one record. Read-only becomes a permission on the view.
    - Diff, preview and stale-owner records stay separate until Phase 3. Any of them that still shares a model URI gets its own URI here.
    - One save queue and one autosave timer per record.
    - Only closing the last view asks to save.
    - The interim adapter's `applyText`, `pending` and `loadFromDisk`.
    - Owner-resolution merge, using the rule for joins where both sides are dirty.
    - The identity rules.
  - **Tests**:
    - Two workspaces on one record, and a view opened later.
    - Discard on a view that isn't the last; one autosave.
    - A rich edit in A while B's editor is mounted.
    - Owner-resolution merging.
    - A read-only sibling mounts while its writable sibling is dirty, and the edits survive.
    - Joins where both sides are dirty: owner resolution, divergent legacy drafts restored in one workspace or two, and a rename onto a dirty record.
    - Key rules: exact case, mixed case sensitivity, WSL aliases, `(runtimeEnvironmentId, targetId)`.
  - **From #30714**: keep the URI shape, the close behaviour and their tests. Drop the per-tab fan-out (`getSameBufferFileIds`).
- **1c. Dirty from alternative version ids.**
  - **Change**: drop the content compare for model edits. Edits from the adapter use the baseline rule above. Recreating a model resets `savedAltVersion`. This comes after 1b because version-based dirty needs exactly one record per model. Any model still owned by more than one record, such as a dirty-and-dirty pair kept separate, keeps the content compare until 1d resolves the pair.
  - **Tests**:
    - Undo back to clean in the code editor and in rich, notebook and CSV views.
    - Dispose and reopen while dirty.
    - Exit before the rich-markdown publish timer fires.
    - Two panes edit within the delay window. The flush is forced, and a stale commit becomes a recoverable copy rather than being applied.
    - The model updates, then a rich edit lands before the view syncs. The stale commit is fenced.
- **1d. Delete caches and stored drafts.**
  - **Change**: delete the panel `fileContents` cache for editable tabs, `use-editor-buffer-content-sync`, and the `OpenFile` mirror fields. Drafts are derived at session save, after flushing pending text. Add the recoverable-copy UI, used for old-format drafts that differ and for dirty owner merges.
  - **Tests**: legacy drafts that differ; a session read by an older build.

Code-editor saves stay unguarded through Phase 1, exactly as on main.

### Phase 2: reload and guarded saves

- **Change**: reload applies as a version-checked, coalesced, undoable edit on the save queue. Keep My Edits records consent. Every save is a guarded write, and a refusal carries `currentSignature`.
- **Deletes**: the Undo toast and its saved snapshot, but only for views whose edits live in the model. Unconverted views (diff, rich, notebook, CSV) keep the toast until each one converts in Phase 3. Also deletes the `orca:editor-file-reloaded` event and unguarded code-editor saves.
- **Tests**:
  - Typing, or a watcher event, during the read.
  - A clean record keeps making progress under writes that keep coming, with no banner.
  - A refusal with no `currentSignature`, followed by the pinned read.
  - Self-write echoes.
  - Undo and redo across the reload boundary.
  - Keep followed by another write.
  - A slow save followed by undo.
  - A file deleted on disk.
  - CRLF, BOM, and an emoji split across two characters.
  - A runtime without the capability.
  - Edit, external change, Reload, then Undo on a real diff view, which still recovers through the toast.
- **From #30681**: keep the version check before applying, the programmatic-edit marker, cancelling reads in progress, and the pause at the undo boundary (now on the record). Drop its one-model-per-tab assumption and its per-tab session field.
- **From #30417**: keep `currentSignature`, Keep as consent, Save while the banner shows as overwrite, deleted-file handling and the line-ending tests. Drop separate models per workspace, the branching on where the file was last edited, and the fallback to the store's draft.

### Phase 3: the remaining views

- **Change**: rich markdown, notebook, CSV, unstaged diffs and mobile saves become native projections of the record, as mapped above.
- **Deletes**: the interim adapter's callers, each view's remaining reload Undo toast as it converts, `diffContents` for editable sides, per-section save state, the "Discard your unsaved edits?" confirmation, and the #30415 watch exceptions.
- **Tests**: each view runs against a real model, and an edit made in one view then saved from another is still guarded.

## Risks and open questions

- **Rich view round trips**: rich markdown or notebook serialization can rewrite bytes the user didn't touch and mark a clean file dirty. Each view needs a round-trip test, and should only replace the text when the serialized output actually differs.
- **Stricter dirty state**: retyping the original text by hand still counts as dirty. Markdown users will notice, because the old check ignored trailing whitespace.
- **Aliases**: a symlink or hardlink still gives one file two records. The host's write lock and the guarded write refuse the stale save.
- **Displayed paths**: for remote files, peek and go-to-definition show the owner folder. They need a display mapping.
- **Memory**: keeping models around for undo after closing must not keep records alive.
- **Open question**: how to show a dirty file whose host stays unreachable.
